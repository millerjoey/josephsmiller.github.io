        <h2>What this is</h2>
        <p>
          Optimal experiment design is a decision system: at each step, pick the next sample that maximally
          reduces uncertainty about the outcome you care about, subject to budget and constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          Example: in deduplication, instead of labeling random record pairs, we label the pairs that most
          clarify cluster membership.

          One adaptive engine that plugs into surveys, A/B tests, pricing experiments, and ML labeling.

          <p class="muted small">A high-level view of sequential design.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="muted">
          Sequential design treats data collection as a control problem: choose the next measurement to
          maximize expected utility (or information) with respect to a target quantity of interest, while accounting
          for uncertainty and constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 0.75rem">
          In practice, this is implemented by maintaining an uncertainty-aware model, evaluating candidate measurements
          via an acquisition objective (e.g., expected information gain about a decision boundary), and iterating until
          the remaining uncertainty is below a chosen tolerance.

          <summary>Hosted vs local demos</summary>
          <p class="muted small">
            The A/B demo is fully static (precomputed plots). The record linkage demo currently runs against a backend
            service; a hosted version is in progress so visitors can upload data directly.
          </p>
          <p class="muted small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem">
            If you need the system to run locally (e.g., for privacy or infrastructure constraints), that is typically
            handled as part of an engagement. Email
