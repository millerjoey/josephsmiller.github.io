        <h2>What this is</h2>
        <p>
          Optimal experiment design provides a way to fit a statistical model with less data: start with some initial data,
          then iteratively choose the next measurement to reduce uncertainty about the quantity that matters for a decision.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          The emphasis is not exploration for its own sake, but learning the specific quantity that drives a decision as
          quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          Example: in deduplication, instead of labeling random record pairs, we label the pairs that most
          clarify cluster membership.
        </p>
        <p class="muted small">
          Typical applications include A/B testing with covariates, record linkage, pricing experiments, adaptive surveys,
          and ML data labeling.

          <p class="muted small">A high-level view of sequential design.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="muted">
          Sequential design treats data collection as a control problem: choose the next measurement to
          maximize expected utility (or information) with respect to a target quantity of interest, while accounting
          for uncertainty and constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 0.75rem">
          In practice, this is implemented by maintaining a posterior (or approximation), evaluating candidate measurements
          via an acquisition objective (e.g., expected information gain about a decision boundary or treatment choice),
          and iterating until the remaining decision uncertainty is below a chosen tolerance.
        </p>
        <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 0.75rem">
          Unlike standard A/B testing, bandits, or generic active learning, the objective here is explicitly tied to the
          decision-relevant quantity—not short-term reward or uncertainty reduction in parts of the model that do not
          change the recommended action.

          <p class="muted small">
            The A/B demo is fully static (precomputed plots). The record linkage demo currently runs against a backend
            service; a hosted version is in progress so visitors can upload data directly.
          </p>
          <p class="muted small" style="margin-top: 0.75rem">
            If you need the system to run locally (e.g., for privacy or infrastructure constraints), that is typically
            handled as part of an engagement. Email
            <a class="text-link" href="mailto:joe@josephsmiller.com">joe@josephsmiller.com</a>
